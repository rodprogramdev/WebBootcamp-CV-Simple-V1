    <table>
        <!--Our columns are astructured together they are indented and it makes it look much neater
            tables also have headers body and footer. 
            Mirroing what we have in our html websites

            YOu can declare them by writing
            thead for table head here we can insert titles and they get formatted by default in bold

            If we create a new table row inside of this row instead of using td elements
            We are going to create a th element or table header cell
            Inside of this element we can give the name of our column.
            
            tbody for table body
            tfoot for table footer

            NOTE: If we try to put our tr with the th elements outside of thead element
            you would notice that the layout applied is just the same. 

            THis is because we are using the special elements the th elements.
            Most browsers know how this is formatted and they look exactly the same. 

            But the reason why we might want to have different sections of our table 
            Putting these cells inside of the table head and putting.

            This is because sometimes we might want to isolate the table header(thead)
            and the table body(tbody)

            In order to style it differently or we might want to make it function in a differnt way. 

            If we separted the table header from the table body, we can use some code to isolate 
            the header and fix it in place.  

            We can see that we can have the heading on screen.

            This will require a little bit more of fancy stuff like css 

            Or javascript which we will talk about later in other modules.

            
            This is one of the main reason why we might want to put inside the table head inside of the thead and the 
            table body inside of the tbody.

            And maybe some table footer. 

            Keynote to remember is that we don't have table columns,
            Td is a single table cell that contains content.
            
            The biggest hurdle is that we don't have table colunms,

            All we can do is to define table rows from top to bottom. 
            Inside each row you are putting in individual cells.

            Each cells are placed horizontally one after another. 
            Creating effectively the columns.

            The main job of tables is to display structured data.

            You can also see how you can use it to affect the layout of the various elements
            of your website.
